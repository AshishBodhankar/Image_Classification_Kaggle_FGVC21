# Leaf-Image-Classification

Apple orchards in the United States are under constant threat from many pathogens and insects. Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection. Incorrect and delayed diagnosis can result in either excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, with increased production costs and increased environmental and
health impacts.

We used an expert-annotated data set of 18,600 apple leaf images provided to the Kaggle community for the Plant Pathology Challenge as part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop.

We trained a baseline sequential CNN model and achieved a validation set accuracy and F-1 Score of 83% and 77% respectively.\
This was our best model as opposed to two other classic CNN architectures (Transfer Learning) fine-tuned for this training set.\ 
InceptionResNetV2 and EfficientNetB1 achieved a validation F1-score of 68.74% and 73.02% respectively.
